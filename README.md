**Sales Dashboard - Data Analysis and Visualization Tool**

This repository contains a Python-based Sales Dashboard application that allows businesses to analyze and visualize their sales data. Built using **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, this tool provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading a CSV file with sales data and generates key metrics and visualizations.

### Features:
- **CSV File Upload**: Upload your sales data in CSV format.
- **Data Analysis**: Automatically calculates:
  - Total Sales
  - Average Sales
  - Top-Selling Product
  - Top Region
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes sales data by region and product with interactive bar plots.
- **Error Handling**: Displays helpful error messages if expected columns are missing or incorrect.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The main programming language used for the app.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, including loading the CSV and calculating key metrics.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for creating sales visualizations.
- **Streamlit**: Powers the interactive web interface for easy access and data exploration.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-dashboard.git`
2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app:  
   `streamlit run app.py`
   
4. Upload your CSV file, and the dashboard will display total sales, average sales, top-selling product, top region, and corresponding visualizations.

### Future Enhancements:
- Adding more complex metrics such as sales growth and forecasting.
- Data filtering by time period, product category, or region.
- Exporting analyzed data as downloadable reports (CSV/PDF).

This project demonstrates how to use Python’s powerful libraries to create a user-friendly tool for sales data analysis and visualization. It’s designed to help both business owners and analysts make informed decisions based on their sales performance data.
